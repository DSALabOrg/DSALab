## Test Cases for Q2

### Test Case 1

**Input**

```
a 1
a 2
a 2
a 1
a 5
a 6
r 6
r 5
p
d
s
e
```

**Output**

```
6
5
Y
1 2
1 2
```

Explanation:

```

a 1: This command inserts a node with the value 1 at the end of the list. The list now looks like this: [1].

a 2: This command inserts a node with the value 2 at the end of the list. The list now looks like this: [1, 2].

a 2: This command inserts another node with the value 2 at the end of the list. The list now looks like this: [1, 2, 2].

a 1: This command inserts another node with the value 1 at the end of the list. The list now looks like this: [1, 2, 2, 1].

a 5: This command inserts a node with the value 5 at the end of the list. The list now looks like this: [1, 2, 2, 1, 5].

a 6: This command inserts a node with the value 6 at the end of the list. The list now looks like this: [1, 2, 2, 1, 5, 6].

r 6: This command removes the node at the 6th position (0-based index) from the list. The removed node's value, 6, is printed. The list now looks like this: [1, 2, 2, 1, 5].

r 5: This command removes the node at the 5th position (0-based index) from the list. The removed node's value, 5, is printed. The list now looks like this: [1, 2, 2, 1].

p: This command checks if the list is a palindrome. Since the list is [1, 2, 2, 1], which reads the same forwards and backwards, the output is 'Y'.

d: This command removes duplicates from the list. After removing duplicates, the list looks like this: [1, 2].

s: This command prints the list. The output is '1 2'.

e: This command exits the program.

```

Explanation:

```
a 1: This command inserts a node with the value 1 at the end of the list. The list now looks like this: [1].

a 2: This command inserts a node with the value 2 at the end of the list. The list now looks like this: [1, 2].

a 3: This command inserts a node with the value 3 at the end of the list. The list now looks like this: [1, 2, 3].

a 4: This command inserts a node with the value 4 at the end of the list. The list now looks like this: [1, 2, 3, 4].

a 5: This command inserts a node with the value 5 at the end of the list. The list now looks like this: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].

r 3: This command removes the node at the 3rd position (0-based index) from the list. The removed node's value, 3, is printed. The list now looks like this: [1, 2, 4, 5].

p: This command checks if the list is a palindrome. Since the list is [1, 2, 4, 5], which does not read the same forwards and backwards, the output is 'N'.

d: This command removes duplicates from the list. Since there are no duplicates in the list, the list remains the same: [1, 2, 4, 5].

s: This command prints the list. The output is '1 2 4 5'.

e: This command exits the program.

```

### Test Case 3

**Input**

```
a 1
a 1
a 1
a 1
d
s
e
```

**Output**

```
1
1
```

Explanation:

```
a 1: This command inserts a node with the value 1 at the end of the list. The list now looks like this: [1].

a 1: This command inserts another node with the value 1 at the end of the list. The list now looks like this: [1, 1].

a 1: This command inserts another node with the value 1 at the end of the list. The list now looks like this: [1, 1, 1].

a 1: This command inserts another node with the value 1 at the end of the list. The list now looks like this: [1, 1, 1, 1].

d: This command removes duplicates from the list. Since all the nodes have the same value, 1, all but one of them are removed. The list now looks like this: [1].

s: This command prints the list. The output is '1'.

e: This command exits the program.

e: This command exits the program.

```

### Test Case 5

**Input**

```
a 1
r 1
s
e
```

**Output**

```
1
-1
```

Explanation

```
a 1: This command inserts a node with the value 1 at the end of the list. The list now looks like this: [1].

r 1: This command removes the node at the 1st position (0-based index) from the list. The removed node's value, 1, is printed. After this operation, the list is empty.

s: This command prints the list. Since the list is empty, the output is '-1' which indicates an empty list.

e: This command exits the program.

```

### Test Case 6

**Input**

```
p
d
s
e
```

**Output**

```
-1
-1
-1
```

Explanation

```
p: This command checks if the list is a palindrome. Since the list is initially empty, there's nothing to check, so the output is '-1' which indicates an empty list.

d: This command removes duplicates from the list. Since the list is empty, there are no duplicates to remove, so the output is '-1' which indicates an empty list.

s: This command prints the list. Since the list is empty, the output is '-1' which indicates an empty list.

e: This command exits the program.
