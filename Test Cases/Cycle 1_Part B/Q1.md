```

Explanation for output

```
p : This command prints the postorder traversal
z : This command prints the zig zag traversal of the tree
m : This command prints the largest element in each level of the tree
d : This command prints the diameter of the tree
s : This command prints the sum of all left leaf nodes in the tree

Explanation for output

```
The tree has only a single node
p : This command prints the postorder traversal
z : This command prints the zig zag traversal of the tree
m : This command prints the largest element in each level of the tree
d : This command prints the diameter of the tree
s : This command prints the sum of all left leaf nodes in the tree
e : exit from the menu driven program

```

### Test Case 5

Input

```
14
11 7 12 4 2 1 8 5 3 13 9 14 6 10
1 2 4 7 11 12 3 5 8 6 9 13 14 10
s
d
m
z
p
e
```

Output

```
32
9
1 3 6 10 14
1 3 2 4 5 6 10 9 8 7 11 12 13 14
11 12 7 4 2 8 5 13 14 9 10 6 3 1
```

Explanation

```
s : This command prints the sum of all left leaf nodes in the tree
d : This command prints the diameter of the tree
m : This command prints the largest element in each level of the tree
z : This command prints the zig zag traversal of the tree
p : This command prints the postorder traversal
e : exit from the menu driven program
```

### Test Case 6

Input

```
13
9 8 4 2 10 5 13 12 11 1 6 3 7
1 2 4 8 9 5 10 11 12 13 3 6 7
d
e
```

Output

```
8
```

Explanation

```
d:path is 9 ->8 ->4 ->2 ->5 ->11 ->12 ->13 so total diameter is 8
e : exit from the menu driven program
```
