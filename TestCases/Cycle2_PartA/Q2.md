Explanation

1. i 20 100, i 40 200, i 60 500, i 70 400: These operations insert the key-value pairs (20, 100), (40, 200), (60, 500), and (70, 400) into the AVL tree. The tree balances itself after each insertion. After these operations, the tree becomes unbalanced at root with LL imbalance, so a right rotation is performed at root.

2. s: This operation prints the number of key-value pairs in the AVL tree. The output 4 indicates that there are four key-value pairs in the tree.

3. e: This operation checks if the AVL tree is empty. The output 0 indicates that the tree is not empty.

4. p: This operation prints the keys in the AVL tree in ascending order. The output 20 40 60 70 is the keys in the tree in ascending order.

5. f 40: This operation searches for the key 40 in the AVL tree. The output 40 200 is the key-value pair for the key 40.

6. l 80: This operation prints the key-value pair of the first element with not less than the given key 80. Since there is no key in the tree that is not less than 80, the output is -1.

7. l 40: This operation prints the key-value pair of the first element with not less than the given key 40. The output 40 200 is the key-value pair for the key 40.

8. l 55: This operation prints the key-value pair of the first element with not less than the given key 55. The output 60 500 is the key-value pair for the key 60, which is the first key not less than 55.

9. e: This operation checks if the AVL tree is empty. The output 0 indicates that the tree is not empty.

10. t: This operation terminates the execution of the program.

Explanation

1. i 24 28: The tree is empty, so the node with key 24 and value 28 is inserted as the root. No balancing is needed.

2. i 82 87: The node with key 82 and value 87 is inserted. Since 82 > 24, it's inserted to the right of the root. The tree becomes unbalanced with a balance factor of -1 at the root. No rotation is needed as the tree is still an AVL tree.

3. i 38 39: The node with key 38 and value 39 is inserted. Since 38 < 82 and 38 > 24, it's inserted to the right of the node with key 24 and to the left of the node with key 82. The tree becomes unbalanced with a balance factor of -2 at the root. A left rotation is performed at the root to balance the tree.

4. i 42 38: The node with key 42 and value 38 is inserted. Since 42 > 38 and 42 < 82, it's inserted to the right of the node with key 38 and to the left of the node with key 82. The tree becomes unbalanced with a balance factor of -2 at the node with key 38. A left rotation is performed at this node to balance the tree.

5. i 624 288: The node with key 624 and value 288 is inserted. Since 624 > 82, it's inserted to the right of the node with key 82. The tree becomes unbalanced with a balance factor of -2 at the node with key 82. A left rotation is performed at this node to balance the tree.

6. i 34 68: The node with key 34 and value 68 is inserted. Since 34 < 38 and 34 > 24, it's inserted to the right of the node with key 24 and to the left of the node with key 38. The tree becomes unbalanced with a balance factor of 2 at the node with key 38. A right rotation is performed at this node to balance the tree.

7. i 898 9246: The node with key 898 and value 9246 is inserted. Since 898 > 624, it's inserted to the right of the node with key 624. The tree becomes unbalanced with a balance factor of -2 at the node with key 624. A left rotation is performed at this node to balance the tree.

8. i 246 6420: The node with key 246 and value 6420 is inserted. Since 246 < 624 and 246 > 82, it's inserted to the right of the node with key 82 and to the left of the node with key 624. The tree becomes unbalanced with a balance factor of -2 at the node with key 82. A left rotation is performed at this node to balance the tree.

9. i 24 8280: The node with key 24 already exists in the tree, so its value is updated to 8280. No balancing is needed.

10. i 38 38: The node with key 38 already exists in the tree, so its value is updated to 38. No balancing is needed.

11. i 624 286: The node with key 624 already exists in the tree, so its value is updated to 286. No balancing is needed.

12. i 246 6410: The node with key 246 already exists in the tree, so its value is updated to 6410. No balancing is needed.
