Explanation for Output

1. Insert 15: The tree is empty, so 15 becomes the root and is colored Black. No fixup is needed.
   - (15 B ( ) ( ))
2. Insert 8: 8 is less than 15, so it becomes the left child of 15 and is colored Red. No fixup is needed.
   - (15 B (8 R ( ) ( )) ( ))
3. Insert 27: 27 is greater than 15, so it becomes the right child of 15 and is colored Red. No fixup is needed.
   - (15 B (8 R ( ) ( )) (27 R ( ) ( )))
4. Insert 34: 34 is greater than 27, so it becomes the right child of 27. However, this would create two consecutive Red nodes (27 and 34), which violates the Red-Black Tree properties. To fix this, the colors of 15, 27, and 8 are flipped, and a right rotation is performed at 15. The tree becomes:
   - (15 B (8 B ( ) ( )) (27 B ( ) (34 R ( ) ( ))))
5. Insert 4: 4 is less than 8, so it becomes the left child of 8 and is colored Red. No fixup is needed.
   - (15 B (8 B (4 R ( ) ( )) ( )) (27 B ( ) (34 R ( ) ( ))))
6. Insert 63: 63 is greater than 34, so it becomes the right child of 34 and is colored Red. However, this would create two consecutive Red nodes (34 and 63), which violates the Red-Black Tree properties. To fix this, the colors of 34, 27, and 63 are flipped, and a left rotation is performed at 27. The tree becomes:
   - (15 B (8 B (4 R ( ) ( )) ( )) (34 B (27 R ( ) ( )) (63 R ( ) ( ))))
7. Insert 22: 22 is less than 27 but greater than 15, so it becomes the left child of 27 and is colored Red. However, this would create two consecutive Red nodes (27 and 22), which violates the Red-Black Tree properties. To fix this, the colors of 34, 27, and 22 are flipped, and a right rotation is performed at 34. The tree becomes:
   - (15 B (8 B (4 R ( ) ( )) ( )) (34 R (27 B (22 R ( ) ( )) ( )) (63 B ( ) ( ))))

10. Insert 48: 48 is greater than 37 but less than 50, so it becomes the right child of 37 and is colored Red. No fixup is needed.
    - (50 B (25 R (12 B ( ) (18 R ( ) ( ))) (37 B (33 R ( ) ( )) (48 R ( ) ( )))) (75 B (62 R ( ) ( )) (87 R ( ) ( ))))
