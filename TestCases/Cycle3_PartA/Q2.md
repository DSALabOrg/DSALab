```

Output

```
1
4
```

Explanation for output

```
Graph is 0->1->2->3 which is a DAG
Strongly connected components are 0,1,2,3
```


### Test Case 2

Input

```

Output

```
-1
2
```

Explanation for output

```
There exists cycles {1,2,4,1},{5,7,6,5} so it is not a DAG
Strongly connected components are {1,2,4},{5,7,6} and 3
```


### Test Case 3

Input

```

Output

```
1
-1
```

Explanation for output

```
There is a cycle {1,2,3,4,5,1} so its not a DAG
Strongly connected components are {1,2,3,4,5}
```

```

Output

```
-1
1
```

Explanation for output

```
The given is a complete grpah with 6 vertices so there exists a cycle due to which it is not a DAG
```

5
```

Explanation for output

```
The cycles are {1,2,1}, {6,7,6} =>so not a DAG
Strongly connected components are {1,2} {6,7} 3 4 5
```
