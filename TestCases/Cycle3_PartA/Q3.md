```
6
0 1 2 3
1 0 2 4
2 0 1
3 0
4 1
5
t
a 0 5
a 1 4
x
```

Output

```
-1
-1
1 4
```

Explanation for output

```
There is an isolated vertex 5 and also a cycle {0,1,2,0} so it is not a tree
There exists no path between 0 and 5
```

### Test Case 2

Input

```
5
0 1 2
1 0 2

x
```

Output

```
-1
0 2
0 1 2
-1
```

Explanation for output

```
There exists a cycle {0,1,2,0} so it is not a tree
```

5
t
a 0 3
a 2 5
x
```

Output

```
-1
0 1 3
-1
```

Explanation for output

```
There is an isolated vertex 5,so not a tree

```


### Test Case 4

2 0 1 3
2 1 3
2 1 0 3
0 1
0 2 1
0 3 1
```

Explanation for output

```
There are 3 cycles {0,1,2,0}, {0,3,1,0} and {0,2,1,3,0} so its not a tree
```

5 0 1 3
5 6 2 1 3
2 1 0 5 6
2 6
```

Explanation for output

```
There is a cycle {0,1,2,6,5.0}  so it is not a tree.
```
